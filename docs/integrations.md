To use 3rd party payment/shipping providers, address complete solutions, gift cards
or any other custom functionality you need to install an integration module.
Integrations for the solutions included into Magento 2 (like free shipping, Paypal, etc.)
are shipped with base module along with some other ones (like stripe one) available here too.

Many of the integrations aren't available for free since they require constant
updates to keep them in sync with provider's external apis.
Access to those modules, along with dedicated human support, custom integration requests, and more
are available under care subscription [here](support.md). 
You also can buy all those modules separately via Magento 2 Extension Store 
(free installation and limited support included).
